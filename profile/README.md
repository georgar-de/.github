## Hi there 👋

The code for my (private) website lives here. The implementation is private, sorry. 

However, I can divulge the following information:
- It is comprised of 4 Rust libraries (authentication interop, backend, frontend, api interop).
- It is written _entirely_ in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)🦀, using [Actix](https://actix.rs) in the backend
  and [Yew](https://yew.rs) on the frontend.
- The frontend gets compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and served as a fat-client to your browser.
